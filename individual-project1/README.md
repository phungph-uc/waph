# WAPH-Web Application Programming and Hacking
## Instructor: Dr. Phu Phung

# Individual Project 1
## Front-end Web Development with a Professional Profile Website on github.io cloud service

## Overview and Requirements 

In this project, you will expand front-end web development skills by developing a Professional Profile Website and deploying it on `github.io` cloud service. This project has general, non-technical, and technical requirements with grade distributions as follows.

### General requirements (30 pts): 

+ Create and deploy a personal website on GitHub cloud (github.io) as a professional profile with your resume, including your name, headshot, contact information, background, e.g., education, your experiences and skills (25 pts).
 ​
+ Create a link to a new HTML page to introduce this "Web Application Programming and Hacking" course and related hands-on projects (5 pts)
 ​
### Non-technical requirements (20 pts)​

+ Use an open-source CSS template or framework such as Bootstrap​

_Target this profile for your potential employer, and your page will be graded as a part of your job application​_

+ Include a page tracker, for example: [https://analytics](https://analytics.withgoogle.com/)](https://analytics.withgoogle.com/), [https://flagcounter.com/](https://flagcounter.com/).

### Technical requirements (50 pts)​

#### Basic JavaScript code (20 pts)​

+ Use jQuery and one more open-source JavaScript framework/library​ to implement JavaScript code introduced in Lab 2, including a digital clock, an analog clock, show/hide your email, and one more functionality of your choice. **(5 pts each)**

+ Two public Web APIs integration (20 pts)​
 _Ensure you include a disclaimer stating that the public/third-party services generate the generated contents below and that you are not responsible._

1. Integrate the jokeAPI ([https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Any](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Any), similar to Lab 2.2.d.i) with `Any` category of joke to display a new joke in your page every 1 minute.

2. Integrate a public API with graphics and display that graphic/image in your page. Examples: [https://xkcd.com/info.0.json](https://xkcd.com/info.0.json), [https://www.weatherbit.io](https://www.weatherbit.io).

+ Use JavaScript cookies to remember the client (10 pts): If first-time visit, display the message "Welcome to my homepage for the first time!"; otherwise, display the message "Welcome back! Your last visit was <the date/time of last visit>" (ensure that you update this value <the date/time of last visit> each time the same user visits -2pts if missing).

## Report

You must write a report using Markdown format following the template/outline provided in Lecture 2 ([https://github.com/phungph-uc/waph/blob/main/README-template.md](https://github.com/phungph-uc/waph/blob/main/README-template.md)) which should include the course name and instructor, your name and email together with your headshot (150x150 pixels), and sub-sections of the assignment's overview, and each task and sub-task.

There should be an overview sub-section where you must write an overview of the assignment and the outcomes you learned from it. Include your website's clickable URL deployed on `github.io`. Also, include a direct clickable link to the project folder on GitHub.com so that it can be viewed when grading, for example, [https://github.com/phungph-uc/waph-phungph/tree/main/individual-project1](https://github.com/phungph-uc/waph-phungph/tree/main/individual-project1).

For each sub-task, write a brief summary of how you completed it. You are welcome to include code snippets and screenshots to demonstrate the outcome; however, they are not required. **Please note that demo screenshots must include your name with proper captions and be visible, i.e., in high resolution, not too blurry, or with much blank space, for grading**. 

Your report must be exported in PDF with its contents and screenshots correctly rendered in proper order. The PDF file should be named `your-username-waph-project1.pdf`, e.g., `phungph-waph-project1.pdf`, and uploaded to Canvas to be submitted by the deadline. 


## Deliverables and Submission

You need to submit **three** deliverables in PDF files for grading:

+ Your report mentioned above.

+ Your deployed website printed from a browser in PDF.

+  The source code of your deployed website printed from a browser in PDF.
